# Cat's New News

Cat's New News is an individual front end project which consolidates my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective.

Please find the link to the hosted version of this project here: "link "

It pulls together all the front-end skills, technologies and best practices I have learnt.

This project make asynchronous API calls to a server I created as part of my back end project. It uses HTTP request types to interact with my backend, and HTTP response codes to update my UI accordingly.
